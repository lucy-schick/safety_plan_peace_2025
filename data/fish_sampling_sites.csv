125000,tributary to Parsnip River,10,577541,6038215,13.4,2.3,4.8,PARS,High priority candidate for restoration. Good habitat.  Surveyed upstream continuosly for 350 m to beaver influenced wetland area where walking became difficult.  Then stream was visited again upstream at 1.6 km upstream from crossing then again at approximately 2.5 km upstream of crossing.  Undercut banks provide areas of deep cover ad Large woody debris is scattered througout. Overhanging vegetationalso provides cover througout.  Pools observed were somewhat shallow but were preseetevery 20 - 30 m or so.  Minnowtrapping conducted upstream and downstream of crossing.  Electrofishing conducted downstream of the crossing.  No fish captured upstream of the culvert. First beaver dam located approximately 330m upstream of the culvert.,-121.8030633532793,54.485632167842525,"c(-121.803063353279, 54.4856321678425, 770.52331424082, 2400)"
