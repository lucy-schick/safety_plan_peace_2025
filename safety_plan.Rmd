The main goal of the fieldwork is baseline monitoring using electrofishing with crews from McLeod Lake. We will be at the six permitted electrofishing sites most of the time.  Additionally, we may conduct fish passage (Phase 1) and habitat confirmation (Phase 2) assessments in the Carp and Crooked watershed groups as well. A summary of the potential sites for fish passage assessments, habitat confirmation assessments, and electrofishing is provided in Table \@ref(tab:tab-electrofishing-sites), with kml (google earth) and gpx (garmin) files downloadable [here](`r knitr::asis_output(link_kml)`).

## Emergency Response Plan {.unnumbered}

New Graph's detailed emergency response procedures can be found [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/hsp/plans-and-assessments.html#emergency-response-plan-erp-and-procedures). These procedures should be reviewed and an emergency response plan should be completed for each job site. Our Emergency Responce Plan template can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/hsp/blob/master/data/form_templates/ERP_template.pdf).

<br>

## Driving {.unnumbered}

We will be driving on forest service roads where it is essential to exercise caution and adhere strictly to all radio use protocols to ensure our safety. Proper communication on these roads helps prevent accidents by keeping everyone informed about vehicle movements and road conditions. Please review the [resource road safety](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/hsp/safe-work-procedures-and-practices.html#resource-road-safety) and [radio use](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/hsp/safe-work-procedures-and-practices.html#radio-use) sections of our Health and Safety plan so that everyone stays safe. 

<br>

## Field Plan {.unnumbered}

The main goal of the fieldwork is baseline monitoring using electrofishing with crews from McLeod Lake. We will be at the 5 or 6 permitted electrofishing sites most of the time.  In addition we may spend some time with fish passage assessments in areas of not only the Parsnip watershed group but also the Carp and Crooked watershed groups.

Field work methods will result in products feeding reporting formats such as [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_peace_2022_reporting/) for 2022 and [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_peace_2023_reporting/) for 2023. We generally follow procedures in:

-   [fish passage assessments](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/land-based-investment/forests-for-tomorrow/field-assessment-for-determining-fish-passage-status-of-cbs.pdf) [@fish_passage_assessments]

-   [habitat confirmations](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/land-based-investment/forests-for-tomorrow/checklist-for-fish-habitat-confirmation-201112.pdf) [@confirmation_checklist_2011].

<br>

Presence/absence of fish, species composition/density and distribution limits can be useful for prioritizing which crossings are a best fit for fish passage restoration and help inform follow up monitoring so electrofishing and minnowtrapping may be conducted. Standard Fish and Fish Habitat Inventory Standard Field Form [site cards](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/laws-policies-standards-guidance/inventory-standards/aquatic-ecosystems) are used to gather habitat data, and the Field Guide to these site cards can be found [here](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/nr-laws-policy/risc/sitecard20.pdf).

<br>

We have PIT tagging equipment so we could consider [tagging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CKZ9yaS5o8) fish captured at electrofishing sites to help us better understand population sizes and fish movement upstream and downstream of sites over the years.

<br>

We use digital field form using a product called [Mergin Maps](https://merginmaps.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwxb2XBhDBARIsAOjDZ34oq-iMid3vRrgK1ZAkJ_yiz4aWY-LLF90PHiXzELbZIrxooV9vWKYaAgl2EALw_wcB) which syncs with QGIS. Please see our [Fish Passage Guidebook](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_guidebook/) for instructions on how to set up Mergin Maps and use our digital field forms. Please send me your usernames and we can begin to share projects/forms.

<br>

A guide to freshwater fish id such as @mcphail_carveth1993FieldKey can be useful and can be downloaded [here](https://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/acat/documents/r13659/486FieldKeytoFreshwaterFishes1993Part1of2_1210014849226_8e248a8d30d97e6c45ef54a340babd2ffb57b14a3b16.pdf).

<br>

### Check In Procedures {-}

Call, text or inreach Tara Stark (2505059854) each morning to share the plan for the day (i.e. name of roads and sites). Check in time is before 7 pm each evening although we regularly check in throughout the day (ex. at arrival to site, 1pm and 4pm) on the inreach or by text and report position/provide updates.

<br>

#### Procedures for Failed Check-In - for Check in person {-}

Procedures are summarized in the following Figure. If phone call or inReach check-in is not received by 7pm send text to inreach units, call or text cell phones of field crew members. If no response please call accommodations then personal emergency contacts to see if they have heard anything. Wait 1 hour and text inreach, text or call cell phones and personal emergency contacts and accomodations again. Repeat after 2 hours (9 pm) - if no response then notify the RCMP of a missing persons in field.
